## CylonJS

An example application using Cylon. It is based on the Websocket example from the same repository.

**This example uses an Intel Edison with the "Grove Starter Kit v3" on a Arduino add-on board, but you can easily modify this to fit your needs.**

**See api.js for connectivity**

This differs from the official socket implementation: https://cylonjs.com/documentation/api/socket-io/
